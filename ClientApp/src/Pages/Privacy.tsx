      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        A cookie is a small amount of information that’s downloaded to your
        computer or device when you visit our Site. We use a number of different
        cookies, including functional, performance, advertising, and social
        media or content cookies. Cookies make your browsing experience better
        by allowing the website to remember your actions and preferences (such
        as login and region selection). This means you don’t have to re-enter
        this information each time you return to the site or browse from one
        page to another. Cookies also provide information on how people use the
        website, for instance whether it’s their first time visiting or if they
        are a frequent visitor.
      </p>
      <p>
        The length of time that a cookie remains on your computer or mobile
        device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie.
        Session cookies last until you stop browsing and persistent cookies last
        until they expire or are deleted. Most of the cookies we use are
        persistent and will expire between 30 minutes and two years from the
        date they are downloaded to your device.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can control and manage cookies in various ways. Please keep in mind
        that removing or blocking cookies can negatively impact your user
        experience and parts of our website may no longer be fully accessible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can choose whether
        or not to accept cookies through your browser controls, often found in
        your browser’s “Tools” or “Preferences” menu. For more information on
        how to modify your browser settings or how to block, manage or filter
        cookies can be found in your browser’s help file or through such sites
        as www.allaboutcookies.org.

      <p>
        Additionally, please note that blocking cookies may not completely
        prevent how we share information with third parties such as our
        advertising partners. To exercise your rights or opt-out of certain uses
        of your information by these parties, please follow the instructions in
        the “Behavioural Advertising” section above.

        browser.
