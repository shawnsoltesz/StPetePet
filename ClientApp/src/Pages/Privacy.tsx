        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          A cookie is a small amount of information that’s downloaded to your
          computer or device when you visit our Site. We use a number of
          different cookies, including functional, performance, advertising, and
          social media or content cookies. Cookies make your browsing experience
          better by allowing the website to remember your actions and
          preferences (such as login and region selection). This means you don’t
          have to re-enter this information each time you return to the site or
          browse from one page to another. Cookies also provide information on
          how people use the website, for instance whether it’s their first time
          visiting or if they are a frequent visitor.
        </p>
        <p>
          The length of time that a cookie remains on your computer or mobile
          device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie.
          Session cookies last until you stop browsing and persistent cookies
          last until they expire or are deleted. Most of the cookies we use are
          persistent and will expire between 30 minutes and two years from the
          date they are downloaded to your device.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can control and manage cookies in various ways. Please keep in
          mind that removing or blocking cookies can negatively impact your user
